In this project, we:
•	Developed a deep learning-based application for food image calorie estimation using Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.
•	Utilized pre-trained object detection models (Faster R-CNN) and fine-tuned them for food recognition tasks.
•	Processed and augmented food image datasets (ECUSTFD) for improved model training and generalization.
•	Implemented machine learning algorithms for image volume and calorie estimation based on detected food items.
•	Evaluated model performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE to ensure accuracy and reliability.
•	Utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.
•	Demonstrated proficiency in working with Google Colab environment and Jupyter notebooks.
•	Applied data wrangling and manipulation techniques to prepare datasets for model training.
•	Conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into food image datasets.
•	Utilized Git for version control and collaboration.
