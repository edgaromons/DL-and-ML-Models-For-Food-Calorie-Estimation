In this project, we:

•	Developed a deep learning-based application for food image calorie estimation using Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.

•	Utilized pre-trained object detection models (Faster R-CNN) and fine-tuned them for food recognition tasks.

•	Processed and augmented food image datasets (ECUSTFD) for improved model training and generalization.

•	Implemented machine learning algorithms for image volume and calorie estimation based on detected food items.

•	Evaluated model performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE to ensure accuracy and reliability.

•	Utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.

•	Demonstrated proficiency in working with Google Colab environment and Jupyter notebooks.

•	Applied data wrangling and manipulation techniques to prepare datasets for model training.

•	Conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into food image datasets.

•	Utilized Git for version control and collaboration.
